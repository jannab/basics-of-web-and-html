	<h2 class="lesson-title">Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
		<div class="concept">
		<h3 class="concept-title">How the Web Works</h3>
		<div class="concept-description">
		<p>The web consists of a lot of computers and servers all over the world. When someone tries to reach a web page like udacity.com, the computer actually sends a <span class="italic">HTTP Request</span> to a <span class="italic">server</span>. The server looks up the right HTML document and sends it back to the computer. Then, the <span class="italic">browser</span> of the person interprets the HTML code and shows the web page accordingly.</p>
		<p>I didn't learn any new concepts here, but <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48329854/m-48480496">this</a> was a great quick review, which was definitely not boring.</p>

		<h3 class="concept-title">HTML</h3>
		<div class="concept-description">
		<p class="concept-description">HTML is an abbreviation for <span class="italic">Hypertext Markup Language</span>. Even though the web contains videos, pictures and much more, most of it is written in HTML and videos and pictures are embedded in the HTML code. In HTML we have text, that describes the texts you see and the markup describes the way it looks.</p>
		<p><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48724340">This</a> was a great overview. It helped me refresh the basic HTML knowledge I have.</p>

		<div class="concept">
		<h3 class="concept-title">Tags and Elements</h3>
		<div class="concept-description">
		<p><span class="bold">Elements</span> in HTML are defined using <span class="bold">tags</span>. An HTML document consits of several elements. A title for example is an element and we would use a h1 tag for that.</p>
		<p><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723444">This</a> video explains the difference between tags and elements well.</p>

		<div class="concept">
		<h3 class="concept-title">Why Computers are Stupid</h3>
		<div class="concept-description">
		<p>Computers just do what you tell them to do, that makes them kind of stupid. Therefore the programmer has to be careful with it's code and small mistakes can cause big problems.</p>
		</div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept">
		<h3 class="concept-title">Inline vs Block Elements</h3>
		<div class="concept-description">
		<p><span class="bold">Block</span> elements have an "invisible box" around them. Therefore, block elements create new paragraphs. <span class="bold">Inline</span> elements can be in a paragraph without having to start a new one.</p>
		<p>I never thought of it that way, but it helps to think of elements that way.</p>

	<h2 class="lesson-title">Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h2>

		<div class="concept">
		<h3 class="concept-title">Developer Tools (in the Browser)</h3>
		<div class="concept-description">
		<p>It is possible to see the source code of every web page through the developer tools of the browser.</p>
		</div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept">
		<h3 class="concept-title">The "tree-like structure" of HTML</h3>
		<div class="concept-description">
		<p>HTML elements can have one or more elements in them. One could say the inner elements of one element are their children. Then it is easy to imagine the elements as persons in a family tree. Therefore HTML has a tree-like structure.</p>
		<p>In a browser, HTML is made of boxes, every shape that you see is in some box. Boxes can be nested in other boxes through the HTML code.</p>
		</div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept">
		<h3 class="concept-title">The relationships between indented HTML and boxes</h3>
		<div class="concept-description">
		<p>When you see HTML code as a text, the code has different levels of indentation. This is due to the fact, that the deeper the boxes represented by the elements are, the more intended they are.</p>
		</div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept">
		<h3 class="concept-title">Text Editors (for programming)</h3>
		<div class="concept-description">
		<p>Text editors for programming highlight some things in different colors, to make the code more readable. Also some help with automatically adding closing tags or insert a whole tag when you type in a few letters.</p>
		<p>One example is Sublime Text (you can download a free version <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">here</a>).</p>
