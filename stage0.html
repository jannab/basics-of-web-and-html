<h1>Getting Started with HTML</h1>
<h2>How the Web Works</h2>
<p>The web consists of a lot of computers and servers all over the world. When someone tries to reach a web page like udacity.com, the computer actually sends a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em>. The server looks up the right HTML document and sends it back to the computer. Then, the <em>browser</em> of the person interprets the HTML code and shows the web page accordingly.</p>
<p>I didn't learn any new concepts here, but <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48329854/m-48480496">this</a> was a great quick review, which was definitely not boring.</p>

<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>HTML is an abbreviation for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. Even though the web contains videos, pictures and much more, most of it is written in HTML and videos and pictures are embedded in the HTML code. In HTML we have text, that describes the texts you see and the markup describes the way it looks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48724340">This</a> was a great overview. It helped me refresh the basic HTML knowledge I have.</p>

<h2>Tags and Elements</h2>
<p><b>Elements</b> in HTML are defined using <b>tags</b>. An HTML document consits of several elements. A title for example is an element and we would use a h1 tag for that.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723444">This</a> video explains the difference between tags and elements well.</p>

<h2>Why Computers are Stupid</h2>
<p>Computers just do what you tell them to do, that makes them kind of stupid. Therefore the programmer has to be careful with it's code and small mistakes can cause big problems.</p>

<h2>Inline vs Block Elements</h2>
<p><b>Block</b> elements have an "invisible box" around them. Therefore, block elements create new paragraphs. <b>Inline</b> elements can be in a paragraph without having to start a new one.</p>
<p>I never thought of it that way, but it helps to think of elements that way.</p>
